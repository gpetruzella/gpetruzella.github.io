<h1>What Can JavaScript Do?</h1>
<h3>Pilfered from w3schools.com, with addenda.</h3>

<h2 id="demo1">JavaScript can change HTML content.</h2>
<!-- Notice that the <h2> has an id property. This is very common, since one way to 'target' an HTML element with JS is by id. -->
<button type="button"
onclick="document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript!'">
Click Me!</button>
<!-- Notice the new <button> element, with its property onclick. The value of onclick is a short JS statement. Note how the statement uses the method "getElementById", and points it at the id "demo1" - from line 19 above. We'll walk through the rest of this syntax together next class. -->

<h2>JavaScript Can Change Images</h2>

<img id="myImage" onclick="changeImage()" src="http://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_bulboff.gif" width="100" height="180">
<!-- Again, using id; also, notice that the onclick value here doesn't include *ALL* the JS, just the function "changeImage()". changeImage() is defined later, in the <script> between lines 33 and 42. -->

<p>Click the light bulb to turn on/off the light.</p>

<script>
function changeImage() {
    var image = document.getElementById('myImage');
    if (image.src.match("bulbon")) {
        image.src = "http://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_bulboff.gif";
    } else {
        image.src = "http://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_bulbon.gif";
    }
}
</script>
<!-- See how much of the 'pseudocoding' logic you can work out, looking at the script above. We'll talk it through together next class. -->

<h2 id="demo3">JavaScript can change the style of an HTML element.</2>

<script>
function myFunction() {
    var x = document.getElementById("demo3");
    x.style.fontSize = "25px";           
    x.style.color = "red"; 
}
</script>
<!-- The script in lines 47-53 defines a function which (i) targets a given HTML element, then (ii) defines methods of changing its properties. This function, while defined here, isn't 'invoked' until the onclick event, below in line 56. -->

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

<h2>JavaScript Can Validate Input</h2>

<p>Please input a number between 1 and 10:</p>

<input id="numb" type="number">
<!-- Ooh, another new HTML element - <input>. Notice how we're using it together with <button>. -->
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction2()">Submit</button>

<p id="demo4"></p>
<!-- Notice line 66: a <p> element with no 'content', just an id property. Its only purpose is to hold the output generated by myFunction2(), as detailed below. When writing a script, it's a very good idea to build something visible to confirm that your function has run successfully: it doesn't happen automatically! -->
<script>
function myFunction2() {
    var x, text;

    // Get the value of the input field with id="numb"
    x = document.getElementById("numb").value;

    // If x is Not a Number or less than one or greater than 10
    if (isNaN(x) || x < 1 || x > 10) {
        text = "Input not valid";
    } else {
        text = "Input OK";
    }
    document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = text;
}
</script>
<!-- Notice that the comments in the JS above (lines 72, 75) serve the purpose of pseudocoding - that is, laying out the plain-language logical structure of the code. It's helpful for interpreting the real code...which might otherwise start to look overwhelming. -->
