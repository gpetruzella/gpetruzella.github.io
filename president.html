<p><strong>October 12, 2016</strong></p>

<p>Greetings APA members,</p>

<p>Please accept, on behalf of the APA Executive Board, our sincere wishes for a great first semester at your local institution. I thought it would be a good time to update the statewide membership on upcoming events important to APA members.</p>

<p>You are probably aware that there is a Federal mandate, coming from the Department of Labor, in December 2016. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is designed to insure that "white collar" workers, will be able to earn overtime if they are **effectively** earning less than $913.00 per week (or the equivalent of $47,476.00 per year), provided also that the employees meet the "duties" description in the Act. (Note: At least 21 states have filed lawsuits, challenging the rule changes. We’ll have to wait and see if these suits delay or change the expected implementation of FLSA.)</p>

<p>Three Local Chapter Presidents; Mark Powers of Framingham, Michael Storey of Bridgewater, Michael Pelletier of Salem; as well as APA VP, Charlie Cianfarini of MCLA and I have been actively involved in negotiating the terms of the APA Agreement that will be affected by FLSA. We are fortunate to be aided by MTA Legal Advisor, Katie D’Urso in these deliberations. The six of us have met twice with representatives on the Management Team and have been working through a variety of issues that may impact our members if FLSA goes live in December.</p>

<p>It is our belief that many issues raised by the implementation of FLSA will profoundly affect exempt APA employees (those members who earn more than $47,476.00 per year and will not be eligible for overtime). Some of these concerns include shifting work from non-exempt employees to exempt employees, salary inequity exacerbated by overtime wages, changing status from full-year employment to partial-year employment, as well as consistent application of non-exempt status across job duties/titles in the state system as a whole. We are, therefore, rolling these negotiations into the full contract talks that will be commencing at the next meeting of APA reps and Management on October 24th.</p>

<p>The impact to employees across the state will range from receiving a salary increase of some amount (in order to surpass the cap) and/or being designated as “non-exempt”; resulting in being able to earn time-and-a-half for hours worked over a 40-hour week and/or being designated as a partial-year (10 month) employee. Clearly, this has HUGE implications to the Institutions’ budgets and is requiring careful consideration for both the campuses and the APA membership. As we get closer to resolving issues, we will certainly post updates on our website - www.maapa.org</p>

<p>We are now also entering into negotiations for the 2017-2019 APA Agreement. With a new administration at the helm of the statehouse, and the Colleges and Universities having to address both the pending FLSA changes and the costs of having to locally fund part of the previous wage increases from the various bargaining units, we are not hearing encouraging news about the BHE’s pending offer. We do know that after many struggles, the Board settled retroactively with the employees of the Community Colleges for a three year contract with increases of 2%, 2.5% and 2.5%. The legislature, just last week, passed a bill to fund those increases. I am hopeful, but not confident, that we may see a similar offer. Time will tell.</p>

<p>We have taken all the feedback we received from the survey we conducted last spring and tried to prioritize the items you have told us are important to you. To those results, we are adding the concerns we have identified as effects of the Fair Labor Standards Act and these, together, have formed the foundation for the strategy of our new APA Agreement negotiations. We are prepared for challenging talks this time.</p>

<p>Across the United States, Labor unions have seen their coalitions struggle to hold on to the benefits for which they have previously bargained. To paraphrase Dylan - "the Times, they are a-Changin'". It is our goal to preserve our benefit package and improve working conditions for our members in the future, by being fully prepared to discuss each article - in detail - and to provide our best suggestions to achieve the goals you have outlined through your participation in the survey. (Of course, we’d also love to see a substantial salary increase offer…but that remains to be seen!) Thank you for your help in identifying the elements of the Agreement that are important to you and those items you’d like to see adjusted. We are all prepared to work hard to realize our mutual goals for these next three years.</p>

<p>As always, we welcome your input and feedback. Each local chapter President is encouraged to attend bargaining sessions, in order to be fully prepared to represent their local chapters. YOU, as the full membership, will have the final say in approving the next Agreement. We’ll keep you posted.</p>

<p>Sincere best wishes to everyone -</p>
<p>Sherry Horeanopoulos</p>
<p>President, Association of Professional Administrators</p>

<p>**Effectively** can mean for work performed over a partial year - and paid out over 12 months</p>
