<p><strong>Course Description:</strong></p>
<p><em>What does it mean to be an American?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This semester we will read and write about American identities. We will question entrenched beliefs, common sense, and explore the origins of American ideas and ideals. You will be asked to critically read, analyze, and write about films, podcasts, and canonical essays on the American condition. All graded assignments build on one another, and include a variety of formal and informal writing exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Required Materials:</strong></p>
<p><em>You must purchase or have access to these materials and bring them to every class meeting. </em></p>

<li>Note taking materials and lined paper, pens, pencils, and highlighters for peer review and group work.&nbsp;</li>

<p>MCLA Writing Studio: For help developing your writing, I suggest that you consider make an appointment at the Writing Studio, please see: <a href="http://www.mcla.edu/writingstudio">www.mcla.edu/writingstudio</a><span>. The MCLA Writing Studio is located at Murdock 120, and is open Monday-Thursday 6:00 pm- 9:00 pm. At the Writing Studio, there are trained writing associates that can help you at any stage of the writing process, and you can schedule an appointment online. </span></p>

<p>Office Hours: If you need further clarification or if you would like to talk through ideas, I also encourage you to come to my office hours listed on the first page of the syllabus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>In my experience, most instances of plagiarism are not intentional but are the result of a student not understanding what qualifies as plagiarism, or not understanding that all material directly taken from a text, or even paraphrased text, must be properly cited. Please consult your <em>Little Seagull Handbook</em>, section R-4 &ldquo;Integrating Sources and Avoiding Plagiarism&rdquo; (pp. 107-118) for useful tips on how to avoid plagiarism. Please see the &ldquo;Academic Honesty, Plagiarism, and Fraud&rdquo; heading under the &ldquo;Course Policies&rdquo; section of this syllabus for my strict plagiarism policy (page 3). For information on MCLA&rsquo;s plagiarism policy please see: <a href="http://www.mcla.edu/Academics/registrar/academicpolicies/index#1A">http://www.mcla.edu/Academics/registrar/academicpolicies/index#1A</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course Policies</strong></p>
<p><u>Decorum:</u> If you choose to take this class you are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend all Peer Review days.</li>
<li>Come to class on time, stay for its duration, and not fall asleep. If you fall asleep in class, I will wake you up. If you fall asleep in class a second time during the same day you will be marked as absent, and I will ask you leave class as this repeated behavior is distracting.</li>
<li>Complete all course readings and assignments.</li>
<li>Bring a copy of all course readings to class the day that we will discuss them (see below Technology Policy).</li>
<li>Not use cell-phones in class.</li>
<li>Be respectful of all students and the professor.</li>
<li>Failure to maintain proper decorum will result in a deduction in the attendance/participation component of the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Attendance:</u> Your attendance and participation are mandatory in passing this class. According to English/Communications Department policy, students are allowed to miss 3 excused absences in a MWF course. Excused absences do not impact your grade, but it is your responsibility to provide me with proper documentation and to get class notes from a peer. &nbsp;In addition, you are allowed two unexcused absences. Your grade will drop 1/3 of a letter grade after two unexcused absences. If you miss 6 or more classes (including your two excused absences), you cannot pass this course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Tardiness:</u> Walking in late to class is disruptive, particularly to a seminar and discussion based class. I understand that sometimes events occur that are outside of our control and may cause you to be late. With this in mind, if you are tardy no more than twice, it will not impact your grade. However, your third tardy will count as an absence. Since the class is only 50 minutes long, if you arrive more than 15 minutes late to class you&rsquo;ve almost missed about 1/3 of the class and you will be marked as absent. If you have a <em>really</em> good reason why you were like for a third time, such as a signed note from your biology professor explaining that you had to stay five minutes late in a lab, I can wave this policy at my own discretion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Emergency Situations:</u> In rare instances, emergency situations occur. If this happens to you, please notify me as soon as possible. See missed work policy for more details. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Revision Policy:</u> Once during the semester, I will allow you to revise an assignment <em>if you come to my office hours to discuss the revision first, prior to revising your essay.</em> If you take advantage of this option, your revised paper, along with your original drafts, are due in hard copy on the last day of class (12/11).</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><u>Technology Policy:</u> You may use laptops in class to look at course readings, our Canvas page, for peer review exercises, and to take notes. Please do not look at email, chat, or look at webpages not approved by the instructor during class. If I catch you, it will negatively impact your attendance/ participation grades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Missed Work</u>: In the rare occurrence of family or personal emergencies that will impact your ability to meet the requirements of this course, I require that you notify me as soon as possible. In such a situation, if you notify me of your inability to complete an assignment prior to the due date, additional accommodations may be arraigned at the discretion of the professor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Turn-It-In and Submission of Written Work: </u>All drafts are submitted through Canvas and Turn-It-In. In addition, you must submit a hard copy of all final drafts only. This software has access to a database of all digitally submitted college papers, as well as academic sources and digital books. If you plagiarize an assignment, your Turn-It-In report (viewable by both you and me) will indicate this information. Make sure to look at your Turn-It-In report (and resubmit before the due date if needed). Please keep in mind that Turn-It-In sometimes mistakes over-quoting or misquoting for plagiarism.</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><u>Academic Honesty, Plagiarism, and Fraud</u>: According to MCLA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Academic Honesty&rdquo; policy, &ldquo;Upon an occurrence of alleged academic dishonesty instructors may exercise<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>their discretion in imposing a sanction</strong>.&nbsp; Instructors may<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>further</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>file charges with the Academic Appeals Committee against students if they believe that additional sanctions would be appropriate.&rdquo; Therefore, in this course if you knowingly plagiarize an assignment you will fail that assignment. If you plagiarize two assignments, you will fail the course and I will file charges with the Academic Appeals Committee. For information on MCLA&rsquo;s plagiarism policy please see: <a href="http://www.mcla.edu/Academics/registrar/academicpolicies/index#1A">http://www.mcla.edu/Academics/registrar/academicpolicies/index#1A</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Citation:</u> Citation must follow Modern Language Association (MLA) citation rules, see your <em>Little Seagull Handbook</em> pp. 119-169.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Accommodations:</u> Reasonable accommodations are available for differently-abled students with college approved documentation. If you&rsquo;re in need of accommodations, please contact me as soon as possible because I want to work with you to help you learn in a way that best fits your needs. For more information about MCLA resources please see the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://mcla.edu/Academics/academicresources/studentsuccess/studentswithdisabalities/index">http://mcla.edu/Academics/academicresources/studentsuccess/studentswithdisabalities/index</a><u>. </u><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Disclaimers:</u> I reserve the right to make changes to the course schedule at any time during the semester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Please keep in mind that this syllabus is a contract between the professor and her students.&nbsp;</em><em>By taking this course you agree to all the course rules and requirements herein.</em></p>
<p><strong>Write-to-Learn Activities</strong></p>
<p>These are short, impromptu, and informal writing assignments designed to help you think through concepts and ideas. These activities will be graded based on your completion of the assignment, not using an A-F grade scale.</p>
<p><strong>Online Journal Entries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Journal entries will be graded for completion (pass/fail), but a consistently high quality of journal entries throughout the term can boost your participation grade as well.</li>
<li>Journal entries must be written before class, and will be discussed in the following class period. All journal entry questions are detailed in the course schedule. These entries should be about 100-150 words. Journal entry prompts are highlighted in blue in the course schedule.</li>
<li>I expect that you will proof-read online journal entries before posting them. Habitual failure to proof read for grammar, spelling, and coherent and complete sentences will impact your final grade.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Free-Writes and Brainstorming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are activities completed during class time. I have written all free-write prompts in the syllabus, but you must write your response to the question during class time in a journal. I don&rsquo;t expect the same level of polished writing for these assignments as I do your submitted essays or online journal posts because you will be writing them during class time without the aid of a word processor or computer. Your journals will be collected during our individual student meetings after Thanksgiving.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A-F Grade Distribution for Formal Written Assignments</strong></p>
<p>You may be used to receiving a letter grade on every assignment that you turn in; however, in this course, you will only receive a letter grade on your final draft. This is because revision, editing, and improvement based on peer and instructor feedback are all part of the writing process. You will be graded on your engagement with this entire writing process. Therefore, you will only receive a grade on your final draft; however, you will receive comprehensive feedback throughout your entire writing process.</p>

<p><strong>A-F Grading Scale</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 616px;">
<p>Though specific criteria will vary depending on assignment (and you&rsquo;ll be given a prompt with genre expectations for each assignment), in general, your letter grades correspond to the following descriptions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A, A- =EXCELLENT: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A-level writing shows sophistication and creativity in relation to the assignment&rsquo;s rhetorical situation; has a clear focus throughout; is well-structured, with clear transitions that show the text&rsquo;s logic, or &ldquo;flow&rdquo;; shows sophisticated use of source material as evidence, including proper source integration and citation practices (if part of the assignment); shows a balance between ideas drawn from outside sources (if applicable) and the writer&rsquo;s own; and last, but not least, shows stylistic and grammatical fluency in relation to the audience it is meant to address. In sum, &ldquo;A&rdquo; papers show mastery of the assignment&rsquo;s rhetorical situation, leaving the reader with new ideas and a lasting final impression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B+, B, B- = GOOD:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>B-level writing shows the writer&rsquo;s ability to respond to an assignment&rsquo;s rhetorical situation in a clear, adequate, if not entirely original way; shows aptitude in organizing and connecting ideas to the essay&rsquo;s overall focus, though occasionally there might be brief lapses in &ldquo;flow&rdquo; between ideas; shows adequate use and citation of source material as evidence (when required), though integration between source material and writer&rsquo;s ideas may at times be awkward; and, though clearly written to a specific audience, may show occasional errors, wordiness, or vague phrasing. Overall, &ldquo;B&rdquo; papers clearly and competently address the assignment and show an adequate engagement with the rhetorical situation.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>C+, C, C- = ACCEPTABLE: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C-level writing responds to the rhetorical situation in a basic way; it may present an overly simple argument or an argument that is implicit rather than explicit; it may appear mostly organized, but could use more consistency with topic, transition, and conclusion sentences; it may rely on summary, general analysis or repetitive content rather than in-depth analysis of source material to forward new ideas; clear distinction between evidence from source material and writer&rsquo;s own ideas may be absent; style may be generic (in 5-paragraph form, for instance), showing little attention to audience, and there may be multiple errors. In sum, a C paper fulfills the major parts of the assignment, but there is room for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>D = INADEQUATE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>D-level writing inadequately addresses the assignment&rsquo;s rhetorical situation; it may lack a clear focus, which affects its organization; examples may be disjointed or not parallel to the argument; when applicable, it may present some misunderstanding of source material, or lack a clear distinction between evidence from source material and writer&rsquo;s own ideas; and it may contain a variety of errors throughout the paper that obscure meaning. Overall, D-level writing may complete the assignment, but the reader may struggle when trying to understand the writer&rsquo;s intention in relation to the rhetorical situation.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>F = UNACCEPTABLE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>F-level writing does not meet the basic requirements of the assignment. It may show a misunderstanding of the assignment&rsquo;s rhetorical situation in topic, genre, use of source materials, or page length; it may lack a clear focus or paragraphs; parts of the essay may be plagiarized and there may be a variety of errors that obscure meaning for the reader. Overall, F-level writing suggests that there is misunderstanding of the assignment and class discussions pertaining to the assignment&rsquo;s rhetorical situation, or that more time should be spent drafting and revising the paper, with feedback from me, your peers, and/or Writing Associates.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>&nbsp;Module 1: &ldquo;What is an American?&rdquo;</strong></span></p>
<p>In this module we will read various writings from notable early Americans who discuss what it means to be an American. The title of this unit, &ldquo;<em>What is an American?&rdquo;,</em> is taken from J. Hector St. John Crevecoeaur&rsquo;s Letter 3 in his text <em>Letters from an American Farmer</em> (1783). We will write about how these early Americans conceptualized a distinct American identity separate from Colonial or British identity. You will write a reflection about what being American or American identity means to you.</p>
